*** Project written as a timed employment test, where I had to teach myself a lot of it on the fly.  Not 'finished' code. ***

Query.py is main library, plus timing and class comments.
QueryServer.py is the server for taking requests
queryPost.py populates it.

fourhourQuery.py shows where I was after four hours.


Testing:

python QueryServer.py &
python queryPost.py

browser testing, URL and expected return: 

http://localhost:8000/?identifier=foo&left=410&right=464
[{"identifier":"bar","ranges":[420, 425],"intersection":5}, {"identifier":"bar","ranges":[460, 800],"intersection":4}, {"identifier":"foo","ranges":[37, 440],"intersection":30}, {"identifier":"foo","ranges":[460, 800],"intersection":4}]
